      <description>I believe that the best way to truly learn a skill, a process or an idea is to build something that demonstrates it. My interest in computer engineering arises from my tendency to explore thought and learning: by combining computer hardware and software, an engineer can manufacture and program an intelligent machine that replicates part of their thinking. During the process of creating such a machine, one must break down the knowledge they want to replicate in its most fundamental parts and create an algorithm that demonstrates these parts.</description>

      <description>I recently came across Hugo the other day while reading this article of my dear friends at deltahacker.gr. Thought it&amp;rsquo;d be a cool little project to make a personal website using Hugo in order to get to know the glory of static website generators and tick &amp;ldquo;Make a personal website&amp;rdquo; off my weekly checklist.
It&amp;rsquo;s been a fun experience and a nice break from revising Linear Algebra.. Next task is to find out why the site&amp;rsquo;s favicon won&amp;rsquo;t appear on Chrome browsers and maybe brainstorm ways I can make use of this place.</description>
